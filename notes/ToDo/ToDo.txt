
Immediate to-do
- add base level progression to the gear and get item's to actually be equipable
- make an hp potion that you can buy.
- a spell that effects the board

long term todo
- add what the bad does - potentially nothing until added.
- different enemies have different abilities
- work on the animations for the -- Should be easy enough to do, most of its done its just hooking it in 
	-player, 
	-enemy
- UI elements. 
- combos
- experience and leveling up for gear
- enemy variation (perhaps an enemy that might heal?)


later later ideas
- shields as equipment - offensive shields.
- while you have shields potentially heal. 



thoughts on gear: What a playable level looks like?
Currently im not sure how two things should occur: Sources of gear
and sources of gear progression.

How to get gear is kinda weird, like having it drop from mobs? Having it be sold by the shop? How often are shops?
Do you split it, being able to craft really good gear, gear drops from mobs and you can snipe purchase from shops?

If you can do lal tehse things then how do duplicates and your inventory work? Combining gear to increase rarity?
What does the progression of combining for rarity do for the items themselveS?

Weapons and their kinda lack of multitudes right now? --  Potentially add range to increase weapon potential types?

Normal gear progression -- you pool experience and then target what gear you wish to upgrade?

increased tick rate as a buff. 

crafting is queued -- to make a potion is like 15 seconds - uses monster drops. 
pausing completely covers the board

potentially split potions and elixirs

shop is where you can get gear
boss's/mini bosses
normal mobs drop gear. 


test push
